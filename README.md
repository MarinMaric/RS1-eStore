# Additional info

Rudimentary Angular front-end for the developer module can be found in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/MarinMaric/RS1Angular)

Database needs to be created locally and the connection string modified in order to run it. Apply the migrations before starting the app.


Web app was made as a project for my university with a pair of colleagues. All functionalities related to the developer module made by me.
